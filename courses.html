                    Opaque generalizations - generalizations that lose support on the surface - have played an important role in the development of phonological theory since the 1950’s and remain at the center of debate until this day. In this course, we will examine the types of opacity attested in the world’s languages and discuss their consequences for phonological architecture. In particular, we will compare serial and parallel computation as well as rule-based and constraint-based computation; we will examine the evidence for abstract levels of representation and empty categories (such as traces) in phonology; and we will discuss the relationship between opacity and iterative or cyclic computation. In addition, we will critically evaluate the evidence suggesting that humans can acquire different kinds of opacity, taking into consideration results from experiments and the evolution of languages over time.

                    This seminar will cover linguistic phenomena that have implications for the theory of the interaction between phonology and morphology. These phenomena include cyclic stress effects, the relationship between affix order and phonology, phonologically-conditioned suppletive allomorphy, and blocking in nonderived environments, among others. Examples of theoretical questions we will discuss include whether morphology precedes phonology (as in Distributed Morphology) or whether the two modules are interleaved (as in Lexical Phonology and Morphology), whether phonology is sensitive to syntactic phases, whether allomorph selection takes place in the phonology, and whether phonological computation is cyclic or transderivational.                </p>

                <p class="card-text">
                    This course covers computational tools that can inform the study of phonological typology and acquisition. In the first part of the course, we will explore recent advances in formal language theory that are relevant to phonology. Focusing on the sub-regular region of the Chomsky Hierarchy of formal languages and maps, we will discuss the computational complexity of phonological patterns attested in natural language, as well as the complexity of unattested hypothetical patterns. We will also discuss computational implementations of rule-based phonology and Optimality Theory. In the second part of the course, we will review a variety of machine-learning algorithms employed in the phonological literature, including supervised and unsupervised algorithms and probabilistic and non-probabilistic algorithms, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages as candidates for a theory of human phonological acquisition.                </p>
