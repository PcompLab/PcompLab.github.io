            <h3>Phonological universals</h3>
            <p>At first sight, the phonological systems of the world’s languages seem remarkably diverse: Hebrew, Korean, Akan, and Ukrainian sound nothing alike. But when we carefully investigate languages at a sufficient level of abstraction, great similarities unravel.  Are there universal phonological rules or principles that hold in every language? Do they reflect innate restrictions on the kinds of phonological systems that humans can acquire? What can they teach us about the computation of phonology in the mind?

                We investigate these questions by constructing candidate universals, testing them using cross-linguistic studies of phonological systems, and examining their consequences for theories of phonology.
                </br></br>
                Examples of research projects on phonological universals:</br>
                • Is the distribution of stress ever directly sensitive to segmental features?</br>
                • Do two phonological processes ever interact like they must apply simultaneously?</br>
                • Is there an intrinsic ordering between stress processes and segmental processes?</br>
                • Is suppletive allomorphy ever sensitive to phrasal phonology?

                <h3>The phonological systems of Judeo-Arabic</h3>
                <p>
                    There are at least eight understudied Jewish varieties of Arabic spoken in Israel by Jewish immigrants from Arab countries (Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen). Those varieties are endangered and are unfortunately expected to disappear in the next decades, as they are not passed on to children as native languages. Our goal is to record, document, and analyze the sound systems of those varieties, investigate their consequences for human cognition, and make the data and results available for the general public. This project thus serves the dual goals of contributing to the preservation of Judeo-Arabic varieties for future generations, while also contributing to our understanding of the human language capacity.

                <h3>Opacity</h3>
                <p>
                    Opaque generalizations - generalizations that lose support on the surface - have played an important role in the development of phonological theory since the 1950's and remain at the center of debate until this day. Do humans indeed acquire generalizations that are not observed on the surface? If so, how are such generalizations discovered? Which opaque patterns are attested in natural languages and which are unattested? What can the typology of opacity teach us about the architecture of phonology? We address these questions by discovering and analyzing attested cases of opacity in the world’s languages, by comparing theories of phonology based on their ability to account for opacity, and by constructing unsupervised learning algorithms that acquire opacity.
                    </br></br>
                    Examples of research projects on opacity:</br>
                    • Self-counterfeeding vowel harmony in Akan</br>
                    • Productive phrasal opacity in Gua</br>
                    • Shifting interactions and countershifting opacity</br>
                    • Across-the-board opacity in Judeo-Baghdadi Arabic</br>
                    • Morpheme structure constraints and blocking in non-derived environments

                <h3>Computational models of phonological learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Children acquiring the morpho-phonology of their language are assumed to face multiple non-trivial learning challenges. They need to learn from distributional evidence alone 	(for example, without systematic negative evidence), learn non-trivial dependencies between morphological segmentation and phonological processes, as well as complex phonological phenomena that are not immediately apparent on the surface, such as optionality and opacity.
                    </br>
                    How do they learn in the face of such challenges, and what can theories of learning teach us about the division of labor between nature and nurture? In collaboration with the TAU Computational Linguistics Lab, we have been exploring a theory of learning based on the principle of Minimum Description Length – a mathematical approximation of Occam’s Razor – according to which children look for the hypothesis that provides the simplest description of their input. We have been implementing computational learning algorithms for phonological acquisition based on this principle under competing phonological theories, with the goal of comparing theories of phonology based on their predictions regarding learning, and advancing our understanding of human phonological acquisition.
                    </br></br>
                    Examples of learning projects:</br>
                    • An unsupervised learning algorithm for Optimality Theory grammars, acquiring the constraints, their ranking, and the underlying representations.</br>
                    • An unsupervised learning algorithm for rule-based phonology, acquiring morphological segmentation simultaneously with the rules, their ordering, and the underlying representations.</br>
                    • Learning opacity from distributional evidence.</br>
                    • Learning abstract underlying representations.</br>
                    • A learnability argument for constraints on underlying representations.</br>
